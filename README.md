Based on the requirements, we will need the following files:

1. `app.py`: This is the main Flask application file. It will contain the routes for the application, including the main route, /transcribe, /interpret, and /send.

2. `templates/index.html`: This is the main HTML template for the application. It will contain the text area, buttons, and table for displaying the data.

3. `static/js/main.js`: This is the main JavaScript file for the application. It will handle the recording of audio, sending requests to the server, and updating the UI.

4. `chatbot.py`: This file will contain the `interpret` function that is used to process the text from the /interpret route.

5. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies for the application.

Now, let's start with the `app.py` file.
